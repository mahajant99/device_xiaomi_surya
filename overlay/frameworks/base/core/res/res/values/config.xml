    <!-- Whether the display cutout region of the main built-in display should be forced to
         black in software (to avoid aliasing or emulate a cutout that is not physically existent).
    -->
    <bool name="config_fillMainBuiltInDisplayCutout">false</bool>

    <!-- The bounding path of the cutout region of the main built-in display.
         Must either be empty if there is no cutout region, or a string that is parsable by
         {@link android.util.PathParser}.
         The path is assumed to be specified in display coordinates with pixel units and in
         the display's native orientation, with the origin of the coordinate system at the
         center top of the display.
         To facilitate writing device-independent emulation overlays, the marker `@dp` can be
         appended after the path string to interpret coordinates in dp instead of px units.
         Note that a physical cutout should be configured in pixels for the best results.
         Example for a 10px x 10px square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z</string>
         Example for a 10dp x 10dp square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z @dp</string>

    <!-- The default refresh rate for a given device. Change this value to set a higher default
         refresh rate. If the hardware composer on the device supports display modes with a higher
         refresh rate than the default value specified here, the framework may use those higher
         refresh rate modes if an app chooses one by setting preferredDisplayModeId or calling
         setFrameRate().
         If a non-zero value is set for config_defaultPeakRefreshRate, then
         config_defaultRefreshRate may be set to 0, in which case the value set for
         config_defaultPeakRefreshRate will act as the default frame rate. -->
    <integer name="config_defaultRefreshRate">90</integer>

    <!-- The default peak refresh rate for a given device. Change this value if you want to allow
         for higher refresh rates to be automatically used out of the box -->
    <integer name="config_defaultPeakRefreshRate">120</integer>
